Next.js is a popular open-source React framework for building modern web applications. It's often used for server-side rendering, static site generation, and serverless functions. With Next.js, developers can create dynamic, SEO-friendly, and high-performance web applications with ease.

Some key features of Next.js include:

1.Server-side rendering (SSR):
Next.js allows you to pre-render React components on the server side before sending them to the client, which can improve performance and SEO.

2.Static site generation (SSG): 
Next.js can generate static HTML files at build time, enabling fast page loads and efficient use of resources.

3.Automatic code splitting: 
Next.js automatically splits your code into smaller chunks, allowing for faster page loads and optimized performance.

4.Routing: 
Next.js provides a file-based routing system, where each page of your application corresponds to a file in the project directory structure.

5.API routes: 
You can create serverless API endpoints within your Next.js application using API routes, making it easy to handle backend logic.

6.Built-in CSS and Sass support: 
Next.js comes with built-in support for styling using CSS and Sass, making it easy to integrate styles into your application.

7.TypeScript support: 
Next.js has excellent support for TypeScript, allowing developers to write type-safe code and catch errors early in the development process.
