Node.js is a powerful and versatile open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to execute JavaScript code server-side. Hereâ€™s an overview of key aspects of Node.js:

Key Features of Node.js

1.Asynchronous and Event-Driven:
Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which makes it lightweight and efficient. This is particularly useful for I/O-heavy operations, such as reading files or handling network connections.

2.Single-Threaded but Highly Scalable:
Despite being single-threaded, Node.js can handle many connections concurrently. It uses an event loop to manage asynchronous operations, allowing for scalability in handling large numbers of simultaneous connections.

3.V8 JavaScript Engine:
Node.js is built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, which compiles JavaScript into machine code, providing fast and efficient execution.

4.NPM (Node Package Manager):
NPM is the default package manager for Node.js and the world's largest software registry. It allows developers to easily install, share, and manage dependencies in their projects.

5.Rich Ecosystem:
With a vast collection of libraries and frameworks available through NPM, Node.js supports a wide range of applications, from web servers and APIs to real-time chat applications and IoT.
