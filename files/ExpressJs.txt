Express.js is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. It is known for its simplicity and ease of use, making it a popular choice for building web applications and APIs. Here’s an overview of Express.js, including its key features and basic usage.

Key Features of Express.js

1.Middleware:
Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the application’s request-response cycle. They can execute code, make changes to the request and response objects, end the request-response cycle, and call the next middleware function in the stack.

2.Routing:
Express provides a powerful routing mechanism that allows developers to define routes for their applications using methods like app.get(), app.post(), app.put(), app.delete(), etc. It also supports route parameters and pattern matching.

3.View System:
Express supports various template engines like Pug (formerly Jade), EJS, and Handlebars. This allows developers to generate HTML dynamically.

4.Robust API:
Express provides a thin layer of fundamental web application features, without obscuring Node.js features. It supports robust APIs to create web servers and handle requests and responses.

5.Easy to Learn and Use:
With minimalistic design and a plethora of available plugins, Express is easy to learn and use, making it a go-to framework for both beginners and experienced developers.
